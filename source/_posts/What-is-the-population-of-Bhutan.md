#  What is the population of Bhutan?

The population of Bhutan is around 870,000 according to a 2016 estimate.

The country has a young population, with nearly half the population below the age of 20. Around two-thirds of the population live in rural areas.

Bhutan has experienced moderate population growth in recent years, with an average annual growth rate of 2.5% between 2003 and 2013. This is largely due to improvements in health and education outcomes, as well as reductions in infant mortality rates.

# What are some of the challenges Bhutan faces due to its growing population?

One challenge is that Bhutanâ€™s limited forest resources are becoming increasingly strained. The country has pledged to maintain at least 60% of its land under forest cover, but this goal is becoming more difficult to achieve as the population expands. Population growth also puts additional pressure on infrastructure and services, such as healthcare and education.

There are concerns that rapid population growth could lead to increased poverty and inequality in Bhutan. It may also constrain economic growth and make it more difficult for the country to achieve its development goals.

#  What is the official language of Bhutan?

The official language of Bhutan is Dzongkha. It is the native language of about two-thirds of the population, and has been designated as the national language. English is also widely spoken and taught in schools.

#  What is the capital of Bhutan?

Thimphu is the capital of Bhutan.

#  What is the world's youngest country?

The world's youngest country is the Republic of Kiribati. It was established on July 12, 1979. The Republic of Kiribati is located in the central Pacific Ocean and consists of 33 islands. The total land area is 811 square kilometers. The population is approximately 102,000.

#  What form of government does Bhutan have?

Bhutan has a constitutional monarchy with the king as the head of state. The king is advised by a council of ministers, and there is a bicameral parliament.
