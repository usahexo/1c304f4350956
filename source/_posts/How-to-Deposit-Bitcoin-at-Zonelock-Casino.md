#  How to Play Blackjack at Zonelock Casino with Bitcoin

In this guide, we are going to teach you how to play blackjack at Zonelock Casino using Bitcoin.

First, you will need to create an account with Zonelock Casino. You can do this by clicking on the “Sign Up” button at the top of the casino’s website.

Once you have created an account, you will need to deposit some Bitcoin into your casino account. To do this, click on the “Deposit” button and select Bitcoin from the list of available currencies.

Now that you have deposited some Bitcoin into your casino account, it is time to start playing blackjack. Simply navigate to the “Blackjack” tab and select your desired game mode.

Once you have selected your game mode, you will be taken to the game table. Here, you can choose your bet amount and hit “Deal” to get started.

The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting a higher score than the dealer or by getting a blackjack (i.e., a score of 21).

To win a hand, you will need to score more points than the dealer without going over 21. The value of each card is as follows:

















If your cards total more than 21 points, then you have gone bust and lose the hand. If the dealer goes bust, then all players still in the game win their bets automatically.

The game of blackjack is all about making sound strategic decisions and using your intuition to beatthe dealer. Here are a few tips to help improve your gameplay:

Stick to basic strategy – Blackjack is a complex game, but if you want to improve your chances of winning, then stick to basic strategy as much as possible. This involves making mathematically sound decisions based on the cards that are in front of you. For example, if you have a weak hand, then it might be prudent to stand instead of hitting further cards in order to increase your chances of winning.Make small bets – Another way to improve your chances of winning at blackjack is by making small bets. This will allow you not only to stay in the game for longer but also increase your potential payout if you happen to win!Split pairs – If you are dealt two cards of equal rank (e.g., two kings), then you can split them into two separate hands by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet amount. This gives you twice as many chances of winning and can be a great way to boost your bankroll!Double down – If you are feeling confident about your hand, then consider doubling down on it by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet amount. Doing so gives you extra insurance against losing while also increasing your potential payout if things go well!
