#  How long has the pharmacy been in business? 

This is a question that can be difficult to answer. A simple search of the internet will not turn up an answer, and even the most knowledgeable pharmacist may be unable to provide a definitive response. The reason for this is that the pharmacy has likely been in business under a variety of names and ownership structures over the years.

The first pharmacy in the United States was established in 1742 by Benjamin Franklin. However, it should be noted that this was not a retail pharmacy; it was instead a dispensary that provided medication to patients who were prescribed by physicians. The first retail pharmacy opened in 1820 in Boston. 

Today, there are more than 27,000 pharmacies nationwide. The industry is highly competitive, and as a result, many pharmacies have closed their doors in recent years. In fact, according to research from the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA), more than 2,500 independent community pharmacies closed between 2010 and 2016. 

So, how long has your local pharmacy been in business? It’s likely that it’s been around for quite some time, but unfortunately there is no easy way to determine exactly how long.

#  Does the pharmacy offer any discounts?

Many pharmacies offer discounts on specific items, such as prescription drugs. However, some pharmacies may not offer any discounts. It is always best to call the pharmacy and inquire about any discounts that they may offer.
